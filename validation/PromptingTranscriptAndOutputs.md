### Sprint Commitment
**Total Committed:** 26 points  
- Story #142: 8 points  
- Story #145: 8 points  
- Story #150: 5 points  
- Bug #89: 2 points  
- Bug #91: 3 points  
**Stretch Goal:** Story #153 (5 points)  
**Sprint Goal:** "Deliver an improved user profile experience with editable details, picture upload, and faster load times, while fixing critical login and rendering bugs."

### Risks & Dependencies
**Risk #1: DevOps Dependency**  
Quote: "For Story #145, DevOps work must be done before frontend integration. I'll handle that in first 2 days." - Carlos  
Impact: Story #145 (Profile Picture Upload) blocked until S3 configuration complete  
Mitigation: Carlos commits to completing in first 2 days

**Risk #2: Infrastructure Access**  
Quote: "For Story #150, I'll need infra access to run DB logs. Priya, can you check with Infra team?" - Mei  
Impact: Performance optimization work may be delayed without proper access  
Mitigation: Priya to escalate with Infrastructure team

**Risk #3: Analytics Impact (Stretch Goal)**  
Quote: "Potential risk: Profile Deactivation (#153) may affect analytics and reporting if we don't exclude deactivated users. We should align with BI team if we end up implementing it." - Riya  
Impact: If stretch goal is implemented, may require BI team coordination  
Mitigation: Align with BI team before implementation

**Risk #4: Reduced Capacity**  
Quote: "Mei, you're out two days next week. Sam, you're supporting the checkout team for one day." - Priya  
Impact: Team down ~3 developer-days  
Mitigation: Reduced sprint commitment from 32 to 28 points capacity

**Risk #5: Safari HEIC Handling**  
Quote: "We'll also need cross-device testing. Safari's HEIC handling might be tricky." - Riya  
Impact: Potential complexity in Story #145 cross-device compatibility  
Mitigation: Dedicated QA device compatibility testing

### Action Items
**Action #1: Escalate Infrastructure Access**  
Owner: Priya (Scrum Master)  
Quote: "Noted. I'll escalate that today." - Priya (in response to Mei's infra access request)  
Due: Today (October 7, 2025)  
Priority: High - blocking for Story #150

**Action #2: Complete S3 Configuration**  
Owner: Carlos (DevOps)  
Quote: "For Story #145, DevOps work must be done before frontend integration. I'll handle that in first 2 days." - Carlos  
Due: Within first 2 days of sprint  
Priority: High - blocking for Story #145

**Action #3: Coordinate with BI Team (Conditional)**  
Owner: Team (if stretch goal pursued)  
Quote: "We should align with BI team if we end up implementing it." - Riya  
Due: Before implementing Story #153  
Priority: Medium - only if stretch goal is picked up

### Team Capacity
**Available:** ~28 story points (reduced from typical 32)  
**Committed:** 26 points  
**Buffer:** 2 points  
**Previous Sprint:** 32 points planned, 29 delivered

**Capacity Adjustments:**
- Mei: Out 2 days next week  
- Sam: Supporting checkout team for 1 day  
- Riya: Fully available  
**Net reduction:** ~3 developer-days
