## ⚠️ Gap Analysis

* **No assignment intelligence:** Existing tools (Otter, ChatGPT, Jira automations, Cursor - Gemini 2.5) extract tasks but don't recommend owners. Assignment stays ad-hoc.
* **Rigid role mapping:** Tools can't reason that a frontend dev with past backend experience could take on a backend story if capacity is limited.
* **No uncertainty handling:** Outputs look polished but never admit missing details — vague stories slip into Jira unflagged.
* **Opaque reasoning:** Current tools don't explain *why* a story belongs to someone.
* **Weak interactivity:** Exports are static; no inline editing or "needs clarification" tags.
