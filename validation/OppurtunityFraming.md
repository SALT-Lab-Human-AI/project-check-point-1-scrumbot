## ðŸŽ¯ Opportunity Framing

ScrumBot fills these gaps by:

1. **RAG-powered owner assignment** â€“ Uses team skill/history/capacity data to assign owners with transparent justifications.
2. **Cross-domain flexibility** â€“ Recognizes stretch experience (e.g., frontend dev with backend exposure) for fairer workload.
3. **Needs clarification workflow** â€“ Flags vague or incomplete stories for human review.
4. **Evidence-grounded output** â€“ Every story/action links to transcript quotes + timestamps.
5. **Seamless Jira-ready export** â€“ Standardized stories with assignees, ready in minutes.
